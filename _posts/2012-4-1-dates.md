We are well underway planning GORUCO 2012 and wanted to let everyone know some key information moving forward.

###Date Confirmed
**The conference will be on Saturday June 23rd, 2012.**

<h2>New Venue</h2>
GORUCO 2012 will be hosted at the <a href="/venue">Altman building</a> in the Flatiron District of Manhattan. It is an awesome space with room for more attendees. We will be accepting around 250 attendees.

###Call for Proposals
**Our CFP will be opening sometime next week.** There are going to be two talk formats:

* Full-Length Talk (45 minutes)
* Micro Talk (less than 10 minutes)

The last day to submit a talk proposal will be April 30th.

###Parties
What GORUCO would be complete without some organized networking over beers? This year is no different. We are planning (not confirmed yet) to have a pre-party the night before (June 22) at Pivotal Labs NYC offices near Union Square.

The after-party is going to take place again the night of the 23rd, although we have not decided on a venue yet.
